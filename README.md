ðŸŒŸAn API which provides users details regarding CafÃ©s in London and allows users to GET cafes data, POST a new cafÃ© entry, PATCH update the coffee price of certain cafe &
DELETE a cafÃ© from the database. The API is built on the REST API architecture and provides access to the cafe database built using SQLite. Postman application is used for
sending requests to API in an easy way. The server for the API is hosted locally using Flask.
